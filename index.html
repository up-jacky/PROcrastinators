							<h2>Overview</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="col-9 col-8-large col-12-large">
							<article class="dynamic-content">
								The "PROcrastinators" project aims to <strong> unravel the complexities of water 
								access and equality</strong> in the Philippines. By analyzing the <strong> availability and 
								distribution of quality water sources</strong> among households <strong> across different 
								regions and demographics</strong>, we seek to uncover disparities and propose actionable 
								solutions. Using data science techniques, our goal is to <strong> provide insights </strong> that 
								contribute to developing strategies for equitable water access in the country.

							<h2>Problem</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="col-9 col-8-large col-12-large">
							<article class="dynamic-content">
								Access to quality water is <strong> highly uneven </strong> in the Philippines, influenced by various 
								demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors. These disparities pose <strong> significant 
								challenges </strong> to ensuring equitable water access, which is <strong> crucial for health, economic 
								development, and overall well-being </strong>. Despite national efforts, many Filipinos still 
								<strong> lack reliable access </strong> to safe water sources, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding 
								of the underlying issues.

							<h2>Solution</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="col-9 col-8-large col-12-large">
							<article class="dynamic-content">
								Our project employs data science methodologies to <strong> examine and understand the disparities </strong> 
								in water access across different demographic groups in the Philippines. By <strong> analyzing data </strong> 
								on water availability, quality, and distribution, we aim to <strong> identify the root causes of 
								inequities and propose targeted strategies </strong> to address these challenges. This approach will
								inform policies and interventions designed to <strong> ensure equitable water access </strong> for all communities.

							<h2>Background</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="col-9 col-8-large col-12-large">
							<article class="dynamic-content">
								Achieving universal access to safe water and sanitation is essential for enhancing human capital, 
								public health, and poverty reduction in the Philippines. Despite government initiatives and investments 
								aimed at meeting the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, many Filipinos still <strong> lack access </strong> to these 
								vital services. The World Bank emphasizes the <strong> importance of improving water and sanitation access </strong> as a 
								priority for the country's development. Challenges such as <strong> limited financial resources, inadequate 
								infrastructure, and the impacts of climate change </strong> further complicate efforts to achieve these goals. 
								Coordinated efforts from national and local governments, along with private sector involvement, are crucial 
								to overcoming these obstacles and ensuring sustainable water access for all.

						<h2>Interpretation of Results and Socio-Economic Impact</h2>
						<p class="solo">
							Our analysis offers a detailed examination of water access disparities across different settings in the Philippines. 
							Here are the key findings from our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning models:

								<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-6 col-6-medium">
										<div class="box">
											<h4>Urban vs Rural Access</h4>
											<p>
												Our EDA reveals that in both <strong> rural and urban settings </strong>, 
												the <strong> majority of households </strong> have <strong>access to improved water 
												sources.</strong> The number of households relying solely on unimproved 
												water sources is significantly lower in comparison. However, 
												<strong> rural areas </strong> still show a <strong> higher proportion </strong> of households using 
												<strong> unimproved water sources </strong> compared to urban areas. This indicates 
												that while improved water access is prevalent, there are still 
												notable gaps in rural regions that require attention.
											</p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="col-6 col-6-medium">
										<div class="box">
											<h4>Regional Disparities</h4>
											<p>
												Households in <strong> rural or economically underdeveloped regions </strong> are more 
												likely to depend on <strong> unimproved water sources.</strong> This reflects the broader 
												issue of <strong> inadequate infrastructure and investment </strong> in these areas. Although
												<strong> improved water sources </strong> are more common, the <strong> persistence of unimproved access </strong>
												points in certain regions <strong> highlights the uneven distribution </strong> of water quality 
												and accessibility.

								<h3>Machine Learning Model</h3>
								<p>
									Our predictive models identified that <strong> geographical location </strong> 
									is a crucial factor in determining water access quality. Households 
									situated in <strong> rural or underdeveloped regions </strong> have a <strong> higher likelihood </strong>
									of relying on <strong> unimproved water sources. </strong> However, our analysis was 
									<strong> limited </strong> by the <strong> lack of detailed data </strong> on other significant factors, 
									such as <strong> household income levels </strong> and the <strong> condition of water supply 
									infrastructure </strong>, which could provide <strong> deeper insights </strong> into the disparities.
